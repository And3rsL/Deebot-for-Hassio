# NodeRED Room Queuing

This NodeRED Flow creates a room queue.
Main advantage is the on the fly adding of new rooms. Selecting a new room won't cancel the current cleaning job. I use it with Aquara Opple switches, so I can select multiple rooms for cleaning without my phone.

## Note
The "last cleaning" image does only show the picture of the latest room.
